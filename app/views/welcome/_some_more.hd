%div
  #### Firstly, we can use images

  %div

    If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

    ![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)


  #### Secondary, we can use links

  %div
    http://github.com - automatic!
    [GitHub](http://github.com)

  #### And! Blockquotes

  As Kanye West said:

  > We're living the future so
  > the present is our past.


  #### And, inline code :)
  I think you should use an
  `<addr>` element here instead.
